# SpaceBattleship

A library implementing the classic game Battleship with generic support for boards of a
variety of shapes, including non-euclidian ones. Currently only basic rectangular boards
are implemented here, but clients can implement their own board shapes by implemeting
`Dimensions`.

An CLI version of the basic 10x10 game based on this library is available in the
`battleship` directory.
